I spent the last week on a road trip and had many thoughts on what to write during those long driving hours. I decided to start with a writing plan. 

I allocate only about an hour to writing blog posts every day. It is likely that I will not finish writing these topics any time soon but let's review it in October. Suggestions on related topics are welcome.  

An updating list: 

## Blog Series 1: Planning and Productivity 

This series will continue on the two previous posts on productivity and planning.

### 1.1. Research Project management with R Studio and Github (check)

How I manage my project materials (data, code, output) and try to make my research reproducible.

### 1.2. Good and bad R code (check)

The principles that I believe to be essential for writing code that is easier for others to understand.

### 1.3. Getting things out of your head

Another post on the book *Getting Things Done*.


## Blog Series 2: Causal inference with observational data

The plan is to review readings on causal inference methodologies, including the new developments that combine machine learning. 

### 2.1. Causal inference in applied social science

Will split this into several posts.

### 2.3. Causal inference with Directed acyclic graphs 

Review of Textor et al. (2017) published on *International Journal of Epidemiology*.
